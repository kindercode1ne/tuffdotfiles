This version I think is only working for sellix pages with stripe payment method.
Please guys leave a like if you want another tool that works on all stripe checkouts and more uhq leaks.

Instalation:
First you need to download MongoDB, just download it and keep it open, then go to your chrome settings => privacy and security => security => manage certifications => import the ca-cert.perm file and
click continue to all options, then download the oxylabs extension and create an new connection with this port = 127.0.0.3:8080.
The last thing you need is open the cmd and do "python mohoe.py" then go to chrome and enter to the settings in "https://mohio/settings" and write the bin that you are going to use and your proxy and save, then go to the folder registerlogin open cmds and do "python main.py" and done you are ready to hit, I recommend private proxy and good bins.
Anyways Im going to leave some bins for you guys hahaha
